      <h2>What Is Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT)?</h2>
      <p class="lead">The aim of AHSCT is to ‘reset’ the immune system to stop it from attacking the body.</p>
      <p> Haematopoietic stem cells are not the type of stem cells that would be expected to change into or regenerate permanently damaged parts of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
      <p>The AHSCT treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody treatments, and therefore is more intensive and higher risk than most other MS treatments.</p>
      <p>We are currently able to offer treatment for patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, Stiff Person Syndrome and Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus.</p>
      <p>You can find out further details below:</p>

        <h3>Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
        <div class="block block-info">
          <h4>Requirements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Have Multiple Sclerosis—Active Relapsing Remitting</li>
            <li>Completed <a title="Multiple Sclerosis Referral Form" href="documents/AHSCT Letter MS.docx">referral form</a> from your Consultant Neurologist, GP, or equivalent Medical Practitioner</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4 class="subtle">Background</h4>
        <p>Clinical trials conducted so far suggest that AHSCT may be able reduce relapses and to stabilise or reduce the level of disability for some people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>
        <p>People with highly active relapsing-remitting MS seem to have the best response to the treatment.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the trials performed to date show that AHSCT does not work well in primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. In view of this data, at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust we are only treating people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>
        <h4 class="subtle">Eligibility</h4>
        <p>If you and your neurologist feel that you have primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis it is very unlikely that AHSCT will be helpful for you, and we are not able to offer treatment for these patients.</p>
        <p>A small number of people have been treated at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with AHSCT outside of a clinical trial setting. These were people with very aggressive relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, who had very frequent and severe relapses which could not be controlled with disease modifying drugs, who we think have the best chance of success with this treatment.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in AHSCT you should speak to your neurologist before contacting the team at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The procedure is high risk so if your neurologist is advising against AHSCT it may be because it is unlikely to be effective in your circumstances based on current research.</p>
        <h4 class="subtle">Referrals</h4>
        <p>Please check against the above eligibility criteria first. If you believe you are suitable for AHSCT treatment, then follow the instructions below.</p>
        <p>Please download a copy of the letter below and read it fully. It provides further information on the application &amp; treatment process for AHSCT.</p>
        <p>Your Consultant Neurologist, GP, or equivalent Medical Practitioner will need to fill out the referral form included. Please return completed forms as instructed in the letter.</p>

        </div>
        <h4 class="subtle">Background</h4>
        <p>While still a novel method of treatment for Stiff Person Syndrome , there have been well reported cases of patients receiving treatment that has led to a remission of symptoms over a sustained period of time.</p>
        <p>The process remains experimental, and clinical trails are ongoing. However, we are able to offer treatment to a limited number of patients at our Hospitals.</p>
        <h4 class="subtle">Eligibility</h4>
        <p> To be able to offer treatment, any patient must have a diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome or Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM), refractory to treatment with IVIG and or plasmapheresis. </p>
